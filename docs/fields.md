# Fields

A resource object's attributes and relationships are collectively called its
"fields".

Fields share a common namespace with each other and with `type` and `id`. In
other words, a resource can not have an attribute and relationship with the same
name, nor can it have an attribute or relationship named `type` or `id`.

Each resource class contains a `fields` method. This method returns an array of
fields, which define the attributes and relationships of the resource.

```php
use Tobyz\JsonApiServer\Schema\Field;
use Tobyz\JsonApiServer\Schema\Type;

class PostsResource extends Resource
{
    // ...

    public function fields(): array
    {
        return [
            Field\Attribute::make('title')
                ->type(Type\Str::make())
                ->writable(),

            Field\Attribute::make('body')
                ->type(Type\Str::make())
                ->writable(),

            Field\Attribute::make('createdAt')
                ->type(Type\DateTime::make())
                ->default(fn() => new DateTime()),

            Field\ToOne::make('author')
                ->type('users')
                ->includable(),

            Field\ToMany::make('comments'),
        ];
    }
}
```

## Visibility

You can restrict the visibility of a field using the `visible` and `hidden`
methods.

You can optionally supply a closure to these methods which will receive the
model instance and should return a boolean value.

For example, the following schema will make an email attribute that only appears
when the authenticated user is viewing their own profile:

```php
use Tobyz\JsonApiServer\Context;
use Tobyz\JsonApiServer\Schema\Field\Attribute;

Attribute::make('email')->visible(
    fn($model, Context $context) => $model->id ===
        $context->request->getAttribute('userId'),
);
```

Hiding a field completely is useful when you want it the field to be available
for writing but not reading – for example, a password field:

```php
Attribute::make('password')
    ->hidden()
    ->writable();
```

## Reading

The fields you define on your resource will be used to serialize models into
JSON:API resource objects.

By default, the value of each field will be retrieved from the model using the
`getValue` method on your resource. A basic implementation is provided for you
in the base `Resource` class:

```php
use Tobyz\JsonApiServer\Context;
use Tobyz\JsonApiServer\Schema\Field;

class Resource
{
    public function getValue(
        object $model,
        Field $field,
        Context $context,
    ): mixed {
        return $model->{$field->property ?: $field->name} ?? null;
    }
}
```

You can override this with an implementation specific to your application's
model layer.

### Properties

In the default implementation of `getValue`, the value is retrieved from the
model using the field's `property` if it is set, otherwise falling back to the
field's `name`.

To configure which property a field represents, use the `property` method:

```php
Attribute::make('firstName'); // Reads from $model->firstName
Attribute::make('firstName')->property('fname'); // Reads from $model->fname
```

### Getters

You can define custom retrieval logic for a specific field using the `get`
method. This will be used to retrieve the value from the model instead of the
resource's `getValue` method:

```php
Attribute::make('firstName')->get(
    fn($model, Context $context) => $model->getFirstName(),
);
```

### Serialization

Once a value has been retrieved, if you would like to perform any conversion
before it appears in the JSON output, you can use the `serialize` method:

```php
Attribute::make('firstName')->serialize(
    fn($value, Context $context) => ucfirst($value),
);
```

### Sparse Fieldsets

[Sparse fieldsets](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets) are
supported on endpoints as per the specification. You can exclude a field from
the fieldset by default, so that it must be explicitly requested, by using the
`sparse` method:

```php
Attribute::make('firstName')->sparse();
```

## Writing

By default, fields are read-only. You can allow a field to be written to in the
[Create](create.md) and [Update](update.md) endpoints using the `writable` and
`readonly` methods.

You can optionally supply a closure to these methods which will receive the
model instance, and should return a boolean value.

For example, the following schema will make an email attribute that is only
writable by the self:

```php
use Tobyz\JsonApiServer\Context;
use Tobyz\JsonApiServer\Schema\Field\Str;

Attribute::make('email')->writable(
    fn($model, Context $context) => $model->id ===
        $context->request->getAttribute('userId'),
);
```

If you only want the field to be writable when a resource is being created, but
not when an existing resource is being updated, you may use the
`writableOnCreate` method:

```php
Attribute::make('email')->writableOnCreate();
```

### Default Values

If you would like to provide a default value to be used when creating a new
resource if there is no value provided in the request, you can pass a closure or
a literal value to the `default` method.

A closure will receive the current request context as an argument when called.

```php
use Tobyz\JsonApiServer\Schema\Field\Attribute;
use Tobyz\JsonApiServer\Schema\Type;

Attribute::make('name')->default('Anonymous');

Attribute::make('joinedAt')
    ->type(Type\DateTime::make())
    ->default(fn(Context $context) => new \DateTime());
```

### Required

By default, writable fields are optional – they can be omitted when creating a
new resource and the server will not complain.

If you would like to mark a writable field as required, so that it must be
provided when creating a new resource, you can use the `required` method:

```php
Attribute::make('email')
    ->writable()
    ->required();
```

### Nullable

By default, writable fields are non-nullable – they cannot be set to `null`. If
you would like to allow `null` as a valid value for a field, you can use the
`nullable` method:

```php
Attribute::make('color')
    ->writable()
    ->nullable();
```

### Deserialization

If you want to perform any conversion on the data provided for a field before it
is validated and saved, you can use the `deserialize` method:

```php
Attribute::make('firstName')->deserialize(
    fn($value, Context $context) => ucfirst($value),
);
```

### Validation

You can assert that the deserialized value provided for a field is valid before
it is saved to the model. Provide a closure to the `validate` method, and call
the `$fail` argument if validation fails:

```php
Attribute::make('email')->validate(function (
    $value,
    callable $fail,
    Context $context,
) {
    if (!filter_var($value, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
        $fail('Invalid email');
    }
});
```

::: tip Laravel Integration  
You can use Laravel's [Validation](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/validation)
component for field validation with the
[`rules` helper function](laravel.md#rules).  
:::

### Setters

By default, the value provided for each field will be set to the model using the
`setValue` method on your resource (which must be implemented as part of the
[Create](create.md) and [Update](update.md) endpoints).

If you would like to define custom hydration logic for a specific field, use the
`set` method:

```php
Attribute::make('name')->set(function ($model, $value, Context $context) {
    $model->first_name = explode(' ', $value)[0];
    $model->last_name = explode(' ', $value)[1];
});
```

### Savers

If you need complete control over how your field is persisted, you can use the
`save` method to provide a closure that will be run **after** your model has
been saved. If specified, the resource's `setValue` method will **not** be
called for the field.

```php
Attribute::attribute('locale')->save(function (
    $model,
    $value,
    Context $context,
) {
    $model
        ->preferences()
        ->where('key', 'locale')
        ->update(['value' => $value]);
});
```
